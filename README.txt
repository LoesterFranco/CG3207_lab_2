DoMath.s - Assembly language program that performs mathematical operations based on DIPS
Procedure:
1. Press any button (BTNL, BTNC, BTNL) to start operation
2. Turn on DIPS to input first binary number.
3. Turn off DIPS and press button to perform specific mathematical operation.
4. Turn on DIPS to input second binary number.

CondLogic.v (Lusi) - Assigns N,Z,C,V flags in synchronous block. Outputs PCSrc, RegWrite, and MemWrite.

Decoder.v (Jenny)

ARM.v (Shukai) - Connect datapath between all the submodules including RegFile, CondLogic, Decoder, Shifter, ALU and ProgramCounter.

test_CondLogic.v - Testbench for CondLogic.v

test_Decoder.v - Testbench for Decoder.v

test_ARM.v - Test bench for ARM.v

test_Wrapper.v - Testbench for Wrapper.v. Simulates three different operations at one go.
